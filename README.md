# TFTechness
For all those unfortunate enough to stumble across this terribleness:
Get out.
Go.
Before it's too late, just go.

On your own head be it.

This is a (terrible) attempt to string together [TerraFirmaCraft](https://github.com/Deadrik/TFCraft) and [team CoFH](https://github.com/CoFH) mods (namely [ThermalFoundation](https://github.com/CoFH/ThermalFoundation)) so that they play together all nice-nice, and CoFH acts a bit more TFCraft-y.

Although not done yet, the plan is to balance the mods so that (stock) TFCraft acts as the early-mid game, and CoFH (and potentially other tech mods) as the late game.

The ultimate goal (which will probably never be reached) is to allow for a TerraFirmaCraft game that starts out being survival-y, manual, tedious, and all the things good ol' TFCraft is, and eventually lead to full automation of everything with the four of us sitting around a table talking about how much happier we were back in the TFCraft days; "Who'd a thought thirty years ago we'd all be sittin' here drinking Chateau de Chassilier?"
